===== MANDATORY PART =====

    Ask explanations about the basics of an HTTP server.
-> handleNewConnection listen and accept every client, by adding non-blocking socket to epoll
-> request is read/parsed in handleClientRead.

    Ask what function the group used for I/O Multiplexing
-> loop relies on epoll_wait, called in epollManager::run
-> avoid blocking on a single socket

    Ask for an explanation of how does select() (or equivalent) work.
-> epoll_wait wakes up as soon as an fd is ready
-> EPOLLIN event : handleClientRead is called, EPOLLOUT event : handleClientWrite is called
-> After a complete read, the write is armed via armWriteEvent, which rewrites the fd with EPOLLIN|EPOLLOUT 
-> allows reading and writing in the same loop without blocking

    Ask if they use only one select() (or equivalent) and how they've managed the server to accept and the client to read/write.
-> in main, loop.run calls the only epoll_wait

    The select() (or equivalent) should be in the main loop and should check file descriptors for read and write AT THE SAME TIME. If not, the grade is 0 and the evaluation process ends now.
-> loop.run (in main) : single epoll_wait in epollManager::run    

    There should be only one read or one write per client per select() (or equivalent). Ask the group to show you the code from the select() (or equivalent) to the read and write of a client.
-> handleClientRead and handleClientWrite only call recv/send once.     

    Search for all read/recv/write/send on a socket and check that, if an error is returned, the client is removed.
-> epollManager::handleClientRead : else if (bytesRead == 0) { closeClient(clientFd); }

    Search for all read/recv/write/send and check if the returned value is correctly checked (checking only -1 or 0 values is not enough, both should be checked).
-> handleClientRead, handleClientWrite, startCgiFor, handleCgiOutEvent, CgiHandler::execute, readParseCGI : OK 

    If errno is checked after read/recv/write/send, the grade is 0 and the evaluation process ends now.
-> epollManager::handleClientRead , epollManager::handleClientWrite, epollManager::handleCgiOutEvent, epollManager::handleCgiInEvent

    Writing or reading ANY file descriptor without going through the select() (or equivalent) is strictly FORBIDDEN.
-> handleClientRead, handleClientWrite,
